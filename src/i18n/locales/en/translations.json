All this is determined automatically depending on the user's actions on the platform.",

    "question7": "Of course. You can register on the platform from anywhere and provide tutoring services based on one of the established tariffs. For this, you must have pedagogical skills, knowledge and experience along with technical ability.",
    "question#8": "How and on what basis is the rating of teachers formed?",
    "question8": "The rating score of the teacher is automatically determined based on his activity in using the platform, education, degree, seniority, local and international diplomas and certificates, the number of students on the platform, the availability of a free trial lesson, and the positive conclusions of students. Teachers with a high rating score are also active in the search engine, and information about them appears first in the search.",
